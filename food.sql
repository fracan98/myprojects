What's interesting is that among the top 10 countries, 
there is Africa with a 30% loss percentage, including two African countries,
Gabon and Algeria. It's worth noting that three Caribbean 
countries are also in the top ranks.
However, it's important to mention that the number of times 
these countries are reported in the database varies. 
For example, Haiti is only reported five times for the same commodity, 
Mango. Therefore, this measure may not be very reliable.
As a result, I have decided to focus only on the countries 
that have been reported more than 15 times over the 21-year period*/
